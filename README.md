Zoho Desk integration for Franz
===============================

This is a development version.

It will display a badge with a number of notifications, an 'indirect notification' badge if there are new tickets in the
current view, as well as desktop notifications.

Improvements considered:

 1. Customize a display of desktop notifications from Zoho Desk.
 2. Do something about the icons (the PNG does not meet the recommended size and there's no SVG icon).

Installation
------------

1. To install a new integration for the first time, download the integration folder e.g. `franz-zoho-desk`.
2. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine (note that this `dev` directory may not exist yet, and you must create it):
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev`
3. Copy the `franz-zoho-desk` folder into the plugins directory
4. Reload Franz
